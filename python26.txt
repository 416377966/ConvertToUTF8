Due to the limitation of embedded Python with Sublime Text, ConvertToUTF8 might not work properly.

To solve this problem, you can try:

1) Install Codecs26 plugin (https://github.com/seanliang/Codecs26). This plugin is compiled under 64bit Ubuntu, I'm not sure if it works with other Linux distro or 32-bit platforms.

2) If the above method doesn't work, you will have to install Python 2.6 manually with these commands:
=====================
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python2.6
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/python2.6 /[PATH_TO_ST2]/lib
=====================
** Note: PATH_TO_ST2 means the installation location of Sublime Text 2 **
